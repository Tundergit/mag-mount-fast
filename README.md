# Tunder MagMount v3 slim added!!  fits Leeco and OnePlus EONs

v3 slim added.  survives 1.4g's longitudinally (launch mode!) and haven't found a pothole or speedbump to shake my EON out yet.

no glue, no screws holding anything together (except the fan screws, but, even those are optional)

print clamp on its side with support, 100% infill
print fan mount with fan side down with supports, you choose infill (50% or more recommended)
print magnet cover however you want, lower infill makes it more flexible and easier to press in 

required to complete: 
-80mm fan (NOCTUA DOES NOT WORK, ARCTIC RECOMMENDED)
-3x10x60mm rare earth magnet (clamp side)
-5x10x60mm rare earth magnet (fan side)
-gopro style mount (pick whatever you want)

# Tunder MagMount v2 still around!  fits Leeco and OnePlus EONs

same printing recommendations as v3 slim 

same materials required to complete as v3 slim EXCEPT:
-2x 5x10x60mm rare earth magnets (there's no 3mm magnet on v2)

v2 has higher magnetic holding strength than v3, so if you have your Tunder MagMount in a Funny Car you might want this one.  both have outrageous strength though.  v3 slim survives 1.4g's longitudinally in my SRT - if your car does 0-60mph in less than 4 seconds you might need v2.
