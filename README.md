Magnetic mount for OP3T for quick and easy removal from your vehicle.  Two parts, a clamp for the phone, and a mount that stays in the vehicle.

Phones, or devices that look like phones, last about three minutes unattended in vehicles in my area.  Save yourself a broken window and picking glass out of the seat of your pants by using this super simple but effective mount.

Version 1 in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu77z3wLCLg

Version 1 and 2 require the following:

Requires 2 60x10x5mm magnets, I used these: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B072K5SLXK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
These magnets are strong.  Don't let them stick together on their own, they'll break.  Literally they'll travel 12 inches to smash each other.  Pretty awesome actually.  They don't seem to impact my OP3T.  If they are, it isn't any system that I'm concerned about.  (as in, the compass probably isn't working well.)  

Uses standard GoPro mount.  Stole this one from my helmet, handy because it's adjustable but keeps its position once you have it set the way you like: https://www.amazon.ca/GoPro-Helmet-Front-Mount-Official/dp/B01GCKO9Z8/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=gopro+helmet+front+mount&qid=1569310333&s=gateway&sr=8-3

A magnetic mount can't be complete without a magnetic connection to your panda: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B078Y4WNVR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
These cables are long, I'm going to shorten one once I'm happy with my giraffe/gauge pod/overhead bin.  These allow for high speed charging and I've had no problems with data transfer.  Use whatever cable suits you.  

I don't like heat sinks, or bulky cases.  Instead, I use a big fan to keep it cool.  I like Noctua, because they're quiet, and the Redux fans are powerful, quiet, and not brown.  https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00KF7P34G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 (the price on these can be funny, I paid $14 CAD.)  I run it at 100%, all the time.  It's 12 volt, so you'll have to figure out how to get power to it (hint - Comma Giraffes have ignition power - get your soldering iron out.)  If you don't use a giraffe, hopefully you have an overhead console with power, or a visor, or, you'll be stuck running wire to it from somewhere.  If soldering isn't your thing, Google "fuse taps."  Self soldering butt connectors are fun too.  Even in the hot summer sun, I've never had a problem with my phone overheating.  As with any solution, this is dependant on the cabin temperature.  Don't leave it in the hot sun without your vehicle running and the AC on unless you like bloated phones.

Version 2 loses the LED indicator tabs, and adds a tube to keep as much air on the phone as possible.  Also removed the requirement for standoffs.  GoPro mount tabs moved slightly to the left to keep the mount as balanced as possible since the phone needs to be slid to the left in its clamp so the camera clears the fan.  I also added a little extra room for the magnets so they should fit a little easier without a ton of post printing work.  No glue required, it's a tight fit.

Both versions offer super easy access to all of the phone's buttons.

I've provided both versions.  I'm currently printing version 2.  PETG or ABS recommended.  I've seen people annealing PLA to raise it's temperature resistance.  This might work for you.  (@zorrobyte, that's you!)  I run PETG printed objects under the hood of my Jeep... and it makes a LOT of heat.  PETG is a pretty solid material.  And it doesn't stink.  Or shrink.  How to print them is dependant on your printer - you'll have to figure that out.  Supports are required on FFF printers, sorry.  You might know or find a better way.  I'd love to see someone print these in SLA.  (If you are interested in printing them in SLA, SLA printers are far more accurate than mine and the tolerances may be too lax.  You might need to use glue for the magnets.)

*** Version 2 is very nice.  If I were you, I wouldn't bother with version 1.  Take your time cleaning it up - I broke the first phone clamp I printed earlier.  It's tight, can't have it sliding around.  The GoPro mount was super tight on mine, it actually broke the actual GoPro ball mount.  Saved it, but be aware. They're very stiff and brittle compared to PETG. 

edit: 20190926 - removed version 1 because it sucks.  Print the clamp on its side with support from the build plate only.
